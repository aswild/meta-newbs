Subject: [PATCH] Revert "kbuild: Fail if gold linker is detected"

It's true that the gold linker can't link the kernel, but Yocto scripts
run "make" a bunch of times during configure and dtb steps and don't
always override LD, resulting in these steps (sometimes silently)
failing.

Yocto does make sure the BFD linker is used when actually building
vmlinux and modules itself, so revert this error to allow all those
other tasks to succeed.

This reverts commit 75959d44f9dc8e44410667009724e4e238515502.
