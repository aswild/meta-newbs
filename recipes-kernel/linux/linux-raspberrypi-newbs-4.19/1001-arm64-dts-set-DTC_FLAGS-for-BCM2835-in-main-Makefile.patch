Subject: [PATCH] arm64: dts: set DTC_FLAGS for BCM2835 in main Makefile

Building the BCM2835 Raspberry Pi device trees requires `-@` in
DTC_FLAGS, which is added by arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/Makefile.

However, subdirectories under boot/dts/ are only descended to when
running `make dtbs` or `make all`. When building individual device tree
files with `make xxx.dtb`, the upper level arch/arm64/boot/dts/Makefile
gets included, but make does not recurse into subdirectories, so
broadcom/Makefile never gets parsed, DTC_FLAGS isn't set, and the
resulting dtb file is broken.

Fix by setting DTC_FLAGS in the main boot/dts/Makefile as well as
boot/dts/broadcom/Makefile.
